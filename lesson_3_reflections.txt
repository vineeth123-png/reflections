When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 A:
   We could use a remote repository when others want to see our improvements hassle-free, like using a better way than carrying them in ubs devices, etc..,
   It would also help us when we've to use our projects in many places and it's easier and safer since, our online servers doesn't get corrupt!
   The most easiest way by which we can request others to either collaborate or encourage them /with a project such that our requirements are met.
